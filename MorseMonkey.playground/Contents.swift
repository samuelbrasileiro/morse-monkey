 # Learn Morse Code by having fun!
 This game was developed focused on children, especially those who use morse code to communicate. It makes the process of learning morse code funnier and engage more people to understand it!
 ### Why Morse?
 Although most people think morse code of an outdated system of encoded comunication, it is, in fact, much more than this.
 
 Nowadays, one of its main key is accessible communication. Many people with disabilities, such as motor ones, recur to morse code to communicate with people, both in person and virtual world. This happens because of morse code simplicity.
 
 For that reason, in our place of priviledge, we must know and understand morse code!
 
 ## The game üêµ
 In the game you will help the monkey to climb an infinite tree and collect bananas. To successifully reach the next branch you need to complete the respective morse code of the word located in the **top right box** by selecting the dot(.) or dash(-) buttons at the bottom. If you guess wrongly the monkey will fall from the tree :(
 
 As you play and your score increases, the difficulty of the encodification will increase and, at some point, you will no longer have help to translate the letters.
 
 But not everything is lost at that moment! As you climb the tree you collect and keep bananas. If the **bottom right button** (üçå) is pressed, a banana is instantly used to autocomplete a letter which translation you don't remember.
 
 Have fun!
